# Istio Destination Rules for Smart Irrigation System
#
# DestinationRules define policies for traffic after routing:
# - Load balancing algorithms
# - Connection pool settings
# - Outlier detection (circuit breaking)
# - TLS settings for service-to-service communication
# - Subsets for canary deployments
